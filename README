NAME
    Proliphix - Talks to Proliphix network thermostats

SYNOPSYS
      #!/usr/bin/perl
      use Proliphix;
  
      my $thermostat = new Proliphix(ip=>'mythermaddress', password=>'mythermpassword');
  
      #requests these OIDs (documented in PDF API available from Proliphix) from the thermostat
      $thermostat->get_oids([qw/4.3.2.1 4.1.1 4.1.3/]);
  
      #sets (writable) OIDs in thermostat. Many values are not writable, see Proliphix documentation.
      $thermostat->set_oids('10.1.6'=>$ARGV[0]);
  
      #lists known values in thermostat. Pounding the device too hard will cause trouble so the module
      #holds on to values until another call to get_oids
      $thermostat->values();

DESCRIPTION
    Module to communicate with Proliphix IP network thermostats. Module is a
    skeleton at best and should probably be written differently for a
    multitude of reasons. I wanted to play around with Moose and was
    disappointed that no one else had written this module, so here's a quick
    iteration that should handle most cases without too much crying.

BUGS
    Almost certainly. Let me know, I'll probably fix them, or send me a
    patch.
